    <h2>
        Whom do you wish were your mentors? <br><img src="https://i.redd.it/6vhj6pipe1131.png">
    </h2>
    <p>
        I wish someone like Elon Musk where my mentor, because he has the work ethic of someone I wish I could compare too. I wonder how he fights off the pressure from everyone around him and just focuses on his goals. <br>
        Or maybe Tony Stark because why not.
